My name is Veyle, i'm a bot made to show data based on the Fire Emblem games! I was created based on the open-source bot Oifey.

All of the commands can also be used via DMs!

To use them, type `/` to see all of the available ones!
To use the classic way (via text), do this:

`@Veyle help`

And a list of commands will be show!
